# LBRY Bot

Botfather for [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) - Which knows everything you want to know

## What?

A Botfather chat bot for LBRY. The one that rule them all!

## Why?

LBRY Bot can be used in chat applications like [Telegram](https://telegram.org/apps) or Discord to parse requests from clients and return useful information about LBRY.

This information could be anything like content, meta-data, network stats, address info, and much more!

And thus eventually to serve the LBRY user (yes, you)!

## How?

LBRY Bot initually will use the [lbry-sdk](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) in order to retrieve information from the LBRY (eg. blockchain status).

Later the [lbrycrd](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) raw API and the more efficient [Chainquery](https://github.com/lbryio/chainquery) will be used to retrieve  more information from the LBRY eco-system.
